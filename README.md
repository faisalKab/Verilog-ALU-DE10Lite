## ðŸ”§ Summary

This ALU was implemented using **pure gate-level logic in Verilog**.  
No behavioral code, no `if` statements, no LUTs â€” only raw logic gates and multiplexers.
I went above and beyond by hardcoding everything using logic expressions instead of software-style conditionals.
Please find the code in .sv file

Designed for the Altera **DE10-Lite FPGA** board.
